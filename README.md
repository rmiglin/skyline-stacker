# skyline-stacker
This is my aA Javascript Project! The object of the game is to stack as many horizontal slices of iconic NYC skyscrapers on top of one another while avoiding the subway rats, pigeons, and roaches. 


# 1. Background and Overview
  My JS project will be a game akin to a sandwich stacking game where an avatar at the bottom of the screen holds up a base layer and must catch other (good) falling pieces onto their growing stack while avoiding bad ones. Each level will get increasingly faster and more difficult and players will be rewarded for building taller skyscrapers and penalized for accidentally stacking subway rats, pigeons, or roaches.
